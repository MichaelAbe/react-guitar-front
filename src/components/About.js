This includes guitar name, model number and serial number, as well timecode for when it was manufactured, date of manufacture, body color, wood grain, etc.. We will also add photos or video so you don't have no idea what's going on! So how does this work? Well we take these records at our shows (we are always looking). When people make their picks up here in Nashville TN, there shouldnÂ´t be much difference between them except maybe some scratches/dents from things like water damage but other than that everything should look clean otherwise I would call any record an official release; something worth buying if anything isn</text>
